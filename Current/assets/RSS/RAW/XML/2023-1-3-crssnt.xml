    Did the War End? Ep. 1: Introduction
   </title>
   <description>
    “Did the War End?” is the Kyiv Independent’s podcast that brings together 
three young Ukrainians exploring what it means to be a nation at war, 
speaking with experts and everyday Ukrainians to help them answer pressing 
questions. (Illustration: Karolina Gulshani) 

The early hours of Feb. 24, 2022 were not something any Ukrainian could 
have imagined. It was a very regular night. Then, millions of people across 
the country woke up to the sounds of explosions, as Russia began its 
full-scale attack on Ukraine, including its capital, Kyiv.

In this episode of our podcast “Did the War End?” the hosts Anastasiia 
Lapatina, Catarina Buchatskiy, and Agatha Gorski discuss how they learned 
that their country was under attack, how they reacted, and what it feels 
like to look back at the start of Russia’s war three months into it. They 
also interview Olga Rudenko, the chief editor of the Kyiv Independent, and 
Anna Myroniuk, the Kyiv Independent’s head of investigations, about the 
decisions they had to make that night.

    UK Defense Ministry: Russia continues to make ‘steady local gains,’ takes control of most of Sievierodonetsk.
   </title>
   <description>
    The U.K. defense ministry said in its daily briefing that Ukraine likely 
still has control over the main road into the Sievierodonetsk pocket but 
Russia continues to advance despite heavy losses, enabling a heavy 
concentration of artillery. It is likely that Russia will need a short 
tactical pause before attempting to cross the Siversky Donets River, a 
natural barrier that is vital for the Russians to cross as they secure 
Luhansk Oblast.

“foresee that because what NATO allies and NATO is doing is to provide 
support to Ukraine to uphold the right for self-defense, and this is a 
right which is enshrined in the UN treaty.”

    CNN: UK to send Ukraine long-range rocket systems.
   </title>
   <description>
    The U.K. will send multiple-launch rocket systems, or M270 launchers, to 
Ukraine, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said on June 1. M270 launchers 
can hit targets up to 80 kilometers away, giving “a significant boost in 
capability for the Ukrainian forces,” according to a statement from the 
U.K. Foreign Office. The decision is “closely coordinated” with the U.S.’ 
provision of HIMARS to Ukraine, a variant of the M270 launchers. The U.K. 
will also train Ukrainian troops to use the rocket systems.

    Reuters: US intends to sell Ukraine armed drones in coming days.
   </title>
   <description>
    The U.S. plans to sell Ukraine four long-endurance MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones, 
which can be armed with up to eight Hellfire missiles, undisclosed sources 
told Reuters. While the sale could still be blocked by Congress, it is 
significant because it would provide Ukraine with an advanced reusable U.S. 
system able to hit deep inside Russia.

    Washington Post: US defends decision to provide Ukraine with HIMARS.
   </title>
   <description>
    U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl dismissed criticism 
that the delayed provision of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems 
to Ukraine comes too late, saying they will “arrive in a time frame that’s 
relevant.” The satellite-guided weapons are the most advanced arms sent to 
Ukraine by the U.S. thus far and will reportedly arrive soon. U.S. State 
Secretary Antony Blinken also dismissed Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov’s 
comment that providing HIMARS is “pouring fuel on the fire,” saying “the 
best way to avoid escalation is for Russia to stop the aggression and war 
that it started.”

    EU imposes partial oil embargo but keeps funding Putin’s war through gas payments
   </title>
   <description>
    *The sections of the second Nord Stream 2 pipeline laid from the German 
shore and Danish waters, connected in a so-called above water tie-in, on 
Sept. 10, 2021. (Nord Stream 2 / Axel Schmidt)* 

The European Union on May 31 finally agreed on a partial embargo on Russian 
oil after months of delays and disagreements. 

However, the move was criticized by some Ukrainians and supporters of 
Ukraine as “too little and too late.” 

“If you ask me, I would say far too slow, far too late and definitely not 
enough,” Ihor Zhovkva, a deputy chief of staff for President Volodymyr 
Zelensky, told Reuters. 

Paradoxically, the very countries that support Ukraine have enabled Russian 
dictator Vladimir Putin to get billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue, 
financing his aggression against Ukraine.  

Since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, there 
have been more and more calls in the European Union for an oil and gas 
embargo against Russia. The main goal of the embargo is to deprive Putin of 
the opportunity to fund the war.

The oil embargo will be less painful for the European economy, since it 
would be relatively easy to replace Russian oil. 

A gas embargo is more tricky since it will take more time and effort to 
entirely get rid of Russian gas. 

But analysts say that both of them are feasible, and the main issue at 
stake is political will. 

European governments will have to withstand pressure from vested interests, 
the business lobby and Russian agents of influence. 

While there has been progress on the oil embargo, a gas embargo is still 
opposed by the EU establishment. 

“Russia wants to see at such (EU) meetings not a unified EU but 27 
individual states – fragments that can’t be put together,” Zelensky said on 
May 30. “Today we see simultaneously the Russian offensive in the Donbas 
destroying our cities and Europe’s unity running the risk of being 
shattered.”

*Statistics *

On May 31, the EU agreed to impose an embargo on seaborne Russian crude oil 
within six months and seaborne Russian oil products within eight months. 

Pipeline oil will be “temporarily” exempt from the embargo during an 
indefinite period, with Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic being able 
to import Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline beyond the end of 2022. 

Seaborne deliveries of Russian oil, which are subject to the embargo, 
account for more than 60% of the EU’s imports of Russian oil. Additionally, 
Poland and Germany have pledged to stop their imports of Russian oil by 
pipeline, which is expected to cut the EU’s total imports of Russian oil to 
90% by the end of 2022. 

Europe’s dependence on Russian energy is significant – a result of what 
critics see as the EU’s failure and reluctance to diversify its energy 
sources for many years. 

Russian gas accounts for about 40% of the EU’s consumption, and Russian oil 
and oil products account for around 30%. 

The EU has paid dozens of billions of euros for Russian oil and gas since 
the invasion began, allowing the Russian economy to withstand the sanctions 
and enabling Putin to continue his costly invasion of Ukraine. 

Russia’s dependence on the European oil and gas market is also immense, 
which will potentially lead to devastating effects for the aggressor 
country when the embargo is enforced. 

Russia exports 70% of its gas and 60% of its oil and oil products to 
Europe. Moreover, oil and gas account for half of the Russian budget and 
half of its exports.

*Redirecting oil supplies *

There is the opinion that the oil embargo will be useless because Russia 
will be able to divert exports to other countries – such as India and 
China. One of its proponents is German economist Jorg Schindler. 

Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of the Energy Industry Research 
Center, a Kyiv-based think tank, disagrees with this theory. He told the 
Kyiv Independent that there are no oil pipelines to ship this oil somewhere 
else and no possibility to transport most of this oil by tanker. There is 
also fierce competition on the oil market, and Russia would not be able to 
elbow its way there, he added. 

Kharchenko said that Russia would only be able to sell a minor part of the 
oil with huge discounts. 

Mikhail Krutikhin, a partner at Russian consulting company RusEnergy, and 
Oleg Buklemishev, head of Russia’s Association of Independent Economic 
Analysis Centers, agreed that Russia is unlikely to redirect most of its 
oil supplies to China, India and other markets, as cited by Deutsche Welle. 

They said that Russia does not have necessary oil pipelines and logistics 
and would have to compete with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 
for new markets. 

*Opposition to the embargo*

The usual argument against the embargo is that the European economy will 
incur significant costs, and energy prices will skyrocket even more.

But Ukraine’s supporters argue that extraordinary times require 
extraordinary decisions, and Europe has to endure some hardship if it wants 
to stop Russia’s aggression. Moreover, analysts say that eventually the 
market is likely to adapt, and the hardships will not be as drastic if the 
embargo is gradual.

Hungary has been the most vehement opponent of the oil embargo. The country 
is headed by Victor Orban, a long-time friend of Putin. 

Other countries that have been lukewarm about the embargo inlcude Germany, 
Slovakia, Austria, and the Czech Republic. 

However, countries like Slovakia depend a lot on Russian oil but they do 
not have relations with Putin similar to Hungary, according to Ukrainian 
political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. 

Germany was initially against an embargo on Russian oil but then changed 
its stance. 

Fesenko argued that delays with the embargo had been due both to the 
business lobby and Russian political influence. 

“Economic interests dominate, and politics is an additional factor,” he 
told the Kyiv Independent. “Putin has corrupted part of European elites and 
mass media.”

There is a strong Russian lobby in Greece, Germany, Austria, France, and 
Italy, Fesenko added. Moreover, France and Germany are currently trying to 
negotiate with Putin, which may also explain their delays with the embargo, 
he said. 

“They support Ukraine morally but when it comes to decisions, they start to 
vacillate and maneuver,” he added.

*Gas embargo *

The situation with the gas embargo is more difficult than with oil. While 
oil can be transported both by tanker and pipeline, gas is mostly 
transported via pipelines. The alternative option – shipping liquified 
natural gas by sea – is less widespread and less developed. 

Economists agree that it will be impossible to replace all of the Russian 
gas quickly. Kharchenko said that it is unlikely to happen within several 
weeks or months. 

The EU still mostly opposes a gas embargo. Austrian Chancellor Karl 
Nehammer said on May 31 that a gas embargo would not be included in the 
EU’s next package of sanctions against Russia. 

However, analysts say that a gradual reduction in Russian gas supplies to 
zero is feasible. Kharchenko said that it’s possible to get rid of Russian 
gas in one and a half years. 

There are analysts who are trying to prove that it’s impossible but they 
are mostly ones backed by Russian gas giant Gazprom, he added. 

The EU has considered compensating for the lost Russian supplies by 
increasing liquified natural gas (LNG) imports, boosting energy efficiency 
and developing nuclear power and other alternative sources of energy. 

Europe can gradually create infrastructure, including pipelines, for 
transporting gas from Russia’s competitors, Kharchenko said.

Some countries have already started to move in this direction.

During the invasion, Germany has cut the share of Russian gas in its 
consumption from 35% to 12%. 

*Russian blackmail *

As Europe considered the oil and gas embargo, Putin resorted to blackmail.

In March Putin demanded that European consumers pay for gas in rubles in an 
effort to strengthen the Russian currency amid its depreciation due to the 
sanctions. This was a violation of the gas supply contracts, which 
stipulated payment in dollars and euros, as well as of the European 
sanctions against Russia.

Eventually the European Union refused to pay in rubles. As a result, the 
Kremlin has come up with a scheme under which buyers are obliged to deposit 
euros or dollars into an account at Russia’s Gazprombank, which has to 
convert them into rubles and transfer the payment to Russian gas giant 
Gazprom.

But Tim McPhee, a spokesman for the European Commission, said on May 12 
that the scheme would breach EU sanctions because it involves Russia’s 
central bank, which has been sanctioned by the European Union.

Some companies have opened accounts with Gazprombank under this scheme but 
its legality is still being considered by the European Commission.

Kharchenko argued that the new scheme is just a face-saving gesture for 
Putin. It does not actually help the Russian economy or strengthen the 
ruble, he added. 

In April Russia resorted to blackmail again, halting gas supplies to Poland 
and Bulgaria due to their refusal to pay for the gas in rubles. Russia also 
stopped gas exports to Finland on May 21 and to the Netherlands on May 31. 

The move was seen as payback for the countries’ support for Ukraine, as 
well as for Finland’s intention to join NATO.

“The worse the blackmail by Russia, the faster they will reject Russian 
gas,” Kharchenko said.

    German defense committee chief urges Scholz to unblock supplies of armored vehicles to Ukraine.
   </title>
   <description>
    Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of the German parliament’s defense 
committee, has called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s office to deliver

    UK Defense Ministry: Russia achieves local successes by massing forces.
   </title>
   <description>
    The ministry said that the strategy of massing forces and fires in a 
relatively small area had enabled Russian troops to achieve local 
successes. In contrast, during the first month of the large-scale invasion, 
Russia suffered military setbacks after scattering its forces over a huge 
area. The ministry said that Russia’s capture of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast 
will help it to achieve its main operational goal, which remains the 
encirclement of Sievierodonetsk and the closure of the pocket around 
Ukrainian forces in Luhansk Oblast. Russia’s political goal is likely to 
occupy the full territory of the Donbas, the ministry added.

    US rejects Russia’s offer to unblock Ukrainian ports in exchange for lifting sanctions.
   </title>
   <description>
    U.S. Department of State spokesman Ned Price called Russia’s suggestion to 
unblock Ukrainian ports in exchange for lifting sanctions “empty promises.” 
“The quickest solution to rising raw material prices and rising food prices 
around the world is to end the Russians’ brutal war,” Price said.

    UK Intelligence: Russia’s airborne forces ‘heavily involved in several notable tactical failures in Ukraine’
   </title>
   <description>
    These failures include the attempted advance on Kyiv via Hostomel Airfield 
in March, the stalled progress on the Izium axis since April, and the 
recent failed and costly crossings of the Siverskyi Donets River, according 
to the latest intelligence update by the U.K. Defense Ministry. The 
misemployment of its elite airborne forces “highlights how Putin’s 
significant investment in the armed forces over the last 15 years has 
resulted in an unbalanced overall force,” the Ministry wrote.

    ISW: Russia preparing for Battle of Sievierodonetsk.
   </title>
   <description>
    The Institute for the Study of War said in its May 25 assessment that the 
intensity of Russian artillery and air attack, combined with the massing of 
Russian forces from elsewhere suggests Russia may start its offensive on 
Sievierodonetsk prior to cutting off Ukrainian ground lines of 
communication. Russia “may need to conduct a ground offensive on 
Sievierodonetsk in the upcoming days to maintain their pace after 
committing a significant portion of personnel, artillery, aviation, and 
logistics to the front,” the ISW wrote.

    Zelensky: ‘The world wasn’t ready for Ukrainian bravery’
   </title>
   <description>
    “For the bravery of all our people who are not inferior to Russia and 
continue to defend our state,” President Zelensky said during his nightly 
address. In reference to doubts early on in the war that Ukraine would be 
able to withstand Russia’s full-scale war, Zelensky said many “simply did 
not want to take Ukraine into account.” “There was no habit of taking 
Ukraine into account, although there is a habit of taking Russia into 
account, even when there is no objective reason to.”

    In his nightly address, President Zelensky said that while Ukraine’s Armed 
Forces are resisting Russia’s offensives in the east, in some places Russia 
outnumbers Ukraine in troops and equipment. “We still need the help of

without restrictions, is enough to win,” Zelensky said.

    Oleksandr Striuk, head of the Sievierodonetsk city military administration, 
said despite Russia’s constant attacks, the city is not besieged and has 
enough Ukrainian troops to hold back Russian forces. Striuk said power and 
communications systems are down and while the roads remain dangerous, “you 
can get to the city.” He also said there were casualties due to Russia’s 
attacks on May 25, including two volunteers who died while evacuating.

    UK Intelligence: Russia tries to reinforce its garrison on Zmiinyi Island.
   </title>
   <description>
    According to the recent intelligence update by the U.K. Defense Ministry, 
Russia’s current efforts to augment its forces on Zmiinyi Island (Snake 
Island) in the Black Sea offer Ukraine more opportunities to “engage 
Russian troops and attrit materiel.” However, if Russia “consolidates its 
position on Zmiinyi Island with strategic air defense and coastal defense 
cruise missiles, it could dominate the north-western Black Sea,” the update 
reads.

    According to the UN’s human rights agency, as of midnight on May 9, 
Russia’s war against Ukraine has killed 3,459 civilians and wounded 3,713 
since Feb. 24. The agency believes the actual figures are considerably 
higher. Most of the recorded casualties were caused by the use of explosive 
weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery 
and multiple launch rocket systems.

    Uncovering the scope of the Bucha massacre
   </title>
   <description>

invasion. (AFP/Getty Images) 

BUCHA, Kyiv Oblast – As Ukraine recaptured the town of Bucha, the world saw 
the extent of the violence Russian soldiers inflicted on the civilian 
population.

Since the Russian forces were driven out of Kyiv Oblast, 412 bodies have 
been found in the town’s streets, buildings and mass graves as of April 19, 
according to Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk. Over 600 bodies were reported in 
Bucha District as of April 15, Human Rights Watch reported, citing the 
chief regional prosecutor. 

Over the past three weeks, rescuers, volunteers and journalists have been 
combing through the evidence and survivors’ testimonies to establish what 
happened here over the six weeks of occupation. 

It all came down to one clear fact: Russians had a citywide shooting spree 
in Bucha. According to Fedoruk, over 80% of the bodies have bullet wounds, 
largely in the head and torso. 

“If in Irpin (a city next to Bucha) people died from fragments caused by 
shelling and mortars, in addition to being shot, then in Bucha people were 
mainly just shot,” Taras Vyazovchenko, a city council member, told the Kyiv 
Independent. “There are practically no accidental hits among the victims.”

According to interviews with local officials and over two dozen residents, 
Russian troops killed people both randomly and systematically. They sought 
some people out, like local officials, activists or sometimes just men of 
military age. They killed others on the street for various reasons and 
sometimes no reason at all. 

“There are shootings of peaceful citizens that can’t be explained in any 
way,” Anatoliy Kotesh, a deputy police chief for the Buchanskyi District, 
told the Kyiv Independent. 

While local officials couldn’t give exact figures on how many people were 
found on the streets and how many were found in homes and basements, they 
said the amounts are comparable. 

The Russians split the city into four sections, Fedoruk said. They were 
variously held by units largely composed either of ethnic Russians, ethnic 
Siberians such as Buryats, or the Chechen military, often referred to as 
Kadyrovites after their leader Ramzan Kadyrov. 

The killings hit the Yablonska, Sklozavodska and Lisova Bucha parts of the 
city especially hard, according to the mayor. The area around Yablunska and 
Vokzalna streets saw some of the worst of the carnage. 

“It got to the point where if people were walking to those 
micro-neighborhoods, the Russians told them not to go,” said Bucha 
volunteer Denys, who declined to give his last name for safety reasons.

Other than being killed outright, some locals were tormented by Russian 
troops, who threatened people with death or forced them to obey humiliating 
orders. Others were reportedly abducted to local villages to be tortured 
there, according to Vyazovchenko.

*Hunting people down*

The invaders conducted large-scale searches for local threats throughout 
the city. 

“Since the occupation of the city, every house, every apartment, every 
institution and business was broken into, opened by Russian occupiers,” 
said Fedoruk. “Doors, windows, gates, all were broken and they went in to 
clear.” 

The Russians went around, hunting specific people and types of people. 

“They had printed lists,” Fedoruk said. The lists must have been printed 
out before the war, he believes. People on the lists included political 
leaders, members of the city and regional government. 

Other sources confirmed that there were lists. Vyazovchenko said apartments 
belonging to officials were searched more thoroughly or frequently compared 
to their neighboring flats. According to Vyazovchenko, the Russians also 
looked for activists. 

BBC Ukraine reported that jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s second 
cousin Ilya Navalny was found in a mass grave in Bucha, possibly killed for 
his relation to the Russian dissident or even simply for sharing the same 
last name.

Sklozavodska, Yablonka and Lisova Bucha labeled. These areas have had some 
of the worst civilian casualties in Bucha, with especially many bodies 
found scattered on and near Yablunska and Vokzalna streets. (The Kyiv 
Independent) 

Andrii, a Territorial Defense member who’s currently operating in Bucha, 
Irpin and the nearby villages, told the Kyiv Independent that all military 
service members, people who fought Russian proxies in Donbas, and 
Territorial Defense joinees were persons of interest. Some of them were 
found murdered, with their hands tied behind their backs.

Multiple survivors who stayed in Bucha throughout the occupation told the 
Kyiv Independent that Russian troops were killing men of military age. When 
they didn’t kill them, they threatened to kill them. 

“Yes, they searched the homes… sometimes if they saw men of military age, 
they took them away and they weren’t heard from again,” said Tamara 
Hryhorieva, a custodian at School 3 in Bucha. “I have an acquaintance (in 
Lisova Bucha). They came to her home, took away her husband, her 
brother-in-law and her son.” 

The father of her granddaughter, 28-year-old Territorial Defense member 
Vitaliy Karpenko was also shot in this area on March 4 and his body laid on 
the ground throughout the entire month-long occupation until it could be 
picked up, identified and buried. 

Andrii from Territorial Defense said the Russians employed some local 
informants who rode along in their armored personnel carriers, pointing out 
the homes of the people Russians wanted to hunt down. He declined to give 
his last name because he is helping the Security Service of Ukraine find 
and arrest such people.

Oleksandr Omelyanenko, the chief of police in the Buchanskyi District, 
confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that there were cases of collaboration 
that are being investigated. 

Kotesh, his deputy, said that it’s unclear how much of this happened under 
duress. 

*Shot in their homes and shelters*

Other times, Russians killed people in homes and shelters for reasons that 
are still unknown.

“We can’t explain the logic of Russian occupiers — they killed people over 
any suspicions,” said Kotesh. “(They might have assumed) that he works with 
the Ukrainian military or another reason they most likely invented for 
themselves.”

Tetyana, a young woman who lives near the infamous Yablunska Street, where 
many bodies of civilians were discovered after the liberation of Bucha, 
told the Kyiv Independent that the Russians came into her apartment and 
shot her husband to death for an unknown reason while she was sheltering in 
the basement. 

She declined to give her last name or any more details, saying the memory 
was too painful. 

People who spoke to the Kyiv Independent also said that Russians fired and 
threw grenades into basements where people were hiding.

Tetiana Oleksandrova was forced to take shelter under School No. 3, after 
her apartment was shelled, concussing her. The school basement contained 
mostly elderly women, as well as four people in their 30s — Oleksandrova, 
her husband Andrii Fotchenko, another man, and a disturbed woman named 
Yulia who claimed to have seen her family torn apart by a shell.

Eventually, the Russians came, intending to use the school as a base. A 
Kadyrovite “with jackal eyes” appeared at the top of the basement stairs 
with an assault rifle and opened fire, Oleksandrova said.

The bullets grazed Fotchenko’s rib, hit the other man in the leg and would 
have struck Oleksandrova if she hadn’t pushed someone away and bounced off 
towards the wall. She realized whom she pushed away when she saw Yulia’s 
brains on the basement floor. “That bullet was for me,” she said in 
retrospect.

The Russians then threw four flashbangs into the basement, giving 
Oleksandrova and her cat their second set of concussions. The elderly women 
piped up, telling the Russians that they’re grandmothers and begging them 
not to attack. The remaining 30-somethings claimed to be the seniors’ 
caretakers. “Without them, we’d have been killed,” Oleksandrova said.

Another example could be found on Tarasivska Street, amid a group of 
three-story residences. Local residents told the Kyiv Independent of three 
people who were shot to death inside an apartment. A neighbor, Mykola, said 
that on March 16, Russian soldiers brought a wounded girl to the home of an 
older couple, Viktor and Natalya Mazokha. The young woman was identified as 
23-year-old Karina Yershova, who was likely raped and tortured by the 
Russian troops. 

“I don’t know what happened next but the soldier fired a volley at the 
ground, an officer came in and shot all three of them,” Mykola told the 
Kyiv Independent. Three days later, Mykola and the other neighbors were 
told that there were bodies in the apartment. Over a week later, the 
neighbors were told they had two hours to bury them. 

The three were buried together, along with a man who had been shot down by 
a sniper elsewhere in the immediate area. The four graves were later 
exhumed and the bodies taken away to be medically examined and given a 
proper burial.

four people had been buried by their neighbors after Russians gunned them

*Gunned down on the street*

Still others were killed either randomly or because they happened to be 
outside and the Russians decided to open fire for whatever reason.

Multiple residents of a cluster of nine-story residential buildings on 
Tarasivska Street said that Russian snipers covered the entire area and 
being on the street for any reason was liable to get you shot. 

Six people from the cluster were killed. Another two died from health 
complications because the Russian kill zones prevented medical aid from 
reaching them. 

But more random killings seem to have happened around Yablunska Street, 
where local survivor Nadiia saw a man riding a bike randomly shot to death. 
She declined to provide her last name for security. 


Several minutes away stands another nine-story building where three 
residents were killed by Russians. A dark bloodstain on the pavement marks 
the spot where a man named Oleh fell. He was gunned down for walking around 
a corner, within view of an adjacent building where a high-ranking Russian 
officer was staying, his neighbor, Liudmyla Sulema told the Kyiv 
Independent. 

Another building resident named Artyom descended to the building’s garage 
in the middle of the day. Russian soldiers walked over, opened the garage 
and shot him to death, Sulema said. According to Human Rights Watch, Artyom 
was getting food. Before the invasion, he reportedly worked on a military 
base painting vehicles for the Ukrainian military.

Many people were shot either when they were forced to go outside to 
scrounge for food and water, bury bodies or escape from the occupied city. 

Denys, the volunteer in Bucha, says that some of his friends and neighbors 
have been killed.

“My classmate was shot in his car when he was trying to get out,” he told 
the Kyiv Independent. 

“My neighbor in a different neighborhood went out searching for food with 
his friend,” he continued. “The neighbor was killed and the friend was 
given a wheelbarrow to take him away and bury him somewhere.”

Even being indoors was no guarantee that you wouldn’t be shot from outside. 
A woman from Artyom and Oleh’s building, also named Tetiana, showed the 
Kyiv Independent bullet holes in the glass of her 9th floor balcony. Human 
Rights Watch reported that elsewhere in Bucha, a man was critically wounded 
when bullets came flying through his balcony window. 

*Killings, threats and humiliation for fun*

Oleksandrova, who took shelter at School No. 3 and later at Yablunka 
kindergarten near the housing complex of the same name, said she heard a 
few Russian soldiers admit to taking potshots at people out of boredom. 

“They would say ‘we’re bored,’” she told the Kyiv Independent. “He said, 
‘sometimes we like how you dance to avoid the bullets.’” Oleksandrova’s 
husband, Fotchenko, quoted a Russian soldier as saying “Yes, we’re shooting 
chaotically.”

Others have said that these kinds of attitudes were widespread. 

Vasyl Kozabovsky and his entire family had to face death when Russians 
ordered them out of their shelter and lined them up against the wall of 
their house on Suvorova Street, saying, “now we’re going to shoot you all. 
Our orders are to kill everyone.”

His wife fell to her knees as Kozabovsky pleaded for the Russians to at 
least spare their kids, including his underage son and pregnant daughter, 
who stared directly into the eyes of one of the invaders. “Fine, we won’t 
shoot you,” the Russians eventually said. 

Survivors said Russians sometimes forced people to strip in the cold or put 
sacks on their heads and fired guns next to them.

As Buchans were killed, others would try to bury them, which was extremely 
dangerous.  According to Fotchenko, one young man was shot in the leg while 
burying a body; in the absence of good medical care, the leg had to be 
amputated. 

Vyazovchenko said that in one instance, when two men were killed, their 
relatives were only allowed to bury one. Russians booby trapped the other 
body with an explosive.

He added that some people were abducted from Bucha and taken to nearby 
villages, where they were tortured by the Russians. 

Laura Hvorostyna, who ran the Yablunka kindergarten where many survivors 
took shelter, came up with a phrase for the occupied Bucha experience. 

“It was Auschwitz lite,” she said.

    Who is Viktor Medvedchuk and why his arrest is a big deal
   </title>
   <description>

lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk after being captured on April 12, 2022.

On April 12, the Security Service of Ukraine captured the country’s most 
high-profile pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who had fled from 
house arrest in February after Russia launched its ongoing invasion of 
Ukraine. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested exchanging Medvedchuk for Ukrainians 
held in Russian captivity. 

Commenting on Zelensky’s offer, the Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said 
that Medvedchuk is not a citizen of Russia, and the Kremlin does not know 
whether he wants Russia to interfere in his situation.

*Who is Medvechuk? *

Medvedchuk is a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a co-leader of the 
pro-Kremlin Opposition Platform – For Life party, whose activities were 
banned in March as a result of the Russian invasion. 

Medvedchuk is Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s right-hand man in Ukraine. 

Since the early 2000s, Mevdedchuk has enjoyed close relations with Putin 
and Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and prime minister of Russia. 

In 2004, Putin and Medvedev’s wife became the godparents of Medvedchuk’s 
daughter, and they were filmed meeting at the Medvedchuk’s Simeiz residence 
in Crimea in 2012.

lawmaker and his crony Viktor Medvedchuk in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 
July 18, 2019. (AFP via Getty Images) 

*What is Medvedchuk’s ideology? *

Medvedchuk has advocated for closer ties with Russia for decades. 

In 2012, Medvedchuk founded the Ukrainian Choice group, which supports 
transforming Ukraine into a federation, making Russian the second state 
language and joining the Russian-led Customs Union.

Medvedchuk’s idea of “federalization” is seen as beneficial for Russia 
because Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions may fall into Russia’s orbit 
if they are given autonomy or sovereign status.

lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk attends a parliamentary session at the Verkhovna 
Rada in Kyiv on Aug. 29, 2019. (Getty Images) 

*Has Medvedchuk gotten along with Ukrainian authorities? *

Medvedchuk has enjoyed good relations with most Ukrainian presidents, 
including former President Petro Poroshenko, and with Yulia Tymoshenko when 
she was prime minister. 

Thanks to his ties to the authorities since the 1990s, he has managed to 
build a business empire. He has been accused of rent-seeking and 
profiteering from his ties to the government.

Medvedchuk’s fortunes changed after Zelensky was elected president in 2019. 
The National Security and Defense Council imposed sanctions on Medvedchuk 
and his ally Taras Kozak in February 2021. The council also blocked three 
TV channels officially owned by Kozak but believed to be actually owned by 
Medvedchuk, which he denies.

*What are the charges against Medvedchuk? *

Medvedchuk and Kozak were charged with high treason in May 2021. They were 
suspected of colluding with the Russian government to extract natural 
resources in Russian-annexed Crimea.

In October 2021, Medvedchuk was also charged with treason in a separate 
case. The case concerns the organization of coal supplies to Ukraine’s 
state-owned enterprises from Russian-occupied areas in the Donbas in 
2014-2015. Medvedchuk allegedly held negotiations with Russia and its 
proxies, as well as with the Poroshenko administration, on the coal 
supplies, according to the investigators.

Medvedchuk denies all the accusations.

    US State Department approves potential sale of up to eight F-16 aircraft to Bulgaria.
   </title>
   <description>
    The deal is valued at $1.6 billion to provide Bulgaria with fighter jets 
and related support equipment. According to Reuters, U.S. officials said 
the sale agreement was not directly related to Russia’s war on Ukraine. The 
war has prompted Ukraine’s government to ask that countries with MiG 
aircraft – including Bulgaria – to make them available for use in the fight 
against Russian forces.

    Germany’s software giant SAP keeps its Russian clients despite claims it shut down cloud services in Russia
   </title>
   <description>

The German software giant SAP appears to have been hypocritical about its 
promises to stop providing cloud services to Russian clients over Russia’s 
war in Ukraine.

According to a document obtained by the Kyiv Independent, just a day before 
the company’s public announcement to shut down its cloud services in 
Russia, SAP had sent its Russian customers a letter offering to migrate 
their data outside of Russia in order to maintain access to its services.

SAP had not responded to the Kyiv Independent’s request for comment by the 
time of publication.

Sent on March 23 by SAP’s Executive Board, the letter says that the company 
will be unable to service its data centers in Russia and recommends that 
Russian clients move their cloud data to centers located outside the 
country.

“Many factors, including the loss of redundancy, supply chain issues and 
the inability to secure service and support, are prompting us to actively 
plan to manage your solutions outside of Russia,” the letter reads.

SAP offered the migration option to Russian clients free of charge.  

“We are striving to uphold our commitments to your business during these 
extraordinary times and appreciate your partnership to achieve the greatest 
possible outcome for your business,” the letter reads.

   - 
   - 

The document does not mention Russia’s war against Ukraine, which has 
ostensibly been the reason for the mass exodus of international companies 
from Russia. 

The letter’s tone drastically contrasts SAP’s public statements regarding 
Russia’s war.

On March 24, SAP issued a press release saying: “Russia’s ongoing 
unjustified war is a heartbreaking display of brutality and a violation of 
the fundamental principle of freedom that we share with Ukraine.”

“We remain steadfast in our commitment to support Ukraine by stopping all 
sales and shutting down cloud operations in Russia,” the statement reads. 

SAP has a handful of notorious clients in Russia. They include energy 
companies Gazprom and Rosneft, Sberbank, Rosselkhozbank, and VTB Bank, all 
of which are under economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU and U.K. over 
Russia’s war against Ukraine.

In a March 2 public statement, SAP’s Chief Christian Klein said the company 
was stopping business in Russia and Belarus to align with sanctions and 
pausing all sales of its services and products in Russia and Belarus. The 
company, however, did not address whether Russian and Belarusian businesses 
could continue using its services under existing contracts.

    Editorial: Give Ukraine everything it asks for and now
   </title>
   <description>

*Editor’s note: Editorials are articles that present the opinion of the 
editorial team of the Kyiv Independent. *

We write this editorial with difficulty. Journalists are the people of 
words, but right now it’s hard to find the ones to reflect what we feel. 

The uncovered atrocities of Russians have left us, and millions of others, 
speechless. 

Hundreds of innocent civilians murdered. Men pulled out of their homes and 
executed, their hands tied behind their backs. The elderly shot dead on the 
side of the road. Charred bodies. Women raped in front of their children. 

Photos, videos, and personal stories of the most despicable atrocities 
began to flow in the moment Russians were forced out of Kyiv Oblast. 

Just like Srebrenica was once simply a city, and Treblinka a village, Bucha 
was a peaceful town near Kyiv. Now it is, too, forever associated with a 
massacre.

Like many atrocities in the past, this massacre could have been prevented 
if certain people in positions of power had had the courage to take a 
stand. Unfortunately for Ukraine, no Western leader was up for the task. 

The Western leaders of today aren’t the only ones to blame.

“I invite (Angela) Merkel and (Nicolas) Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see the 
outcome of 14 years of concessions to Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky 
said in his video address. “You will see the tortured Ukrainians with your 
own eyes.”

The West’s fear and appeasement of Vladimir Putin and his bloody regime 
have dominated geopolitics for a long time, culminating in Russian war 
crimes against Ukrainians. Like any authoritarian regime, it fed on their 
fear and grew stronger. 

The Bucha massacre did not have to happen. The modern world could have 
prevented it – by imposing a no-fly zone above Ukraine or providing it with 
fighter jets and air defense systems, as President Volodymyr Zelensky has 
repeatedly asked. If Ukraine had increased its air presence, Russian forces 
would likely have had to retreat from Bucha and other areas much sooner. 
The lives of hundreds of innocent people would have been saved.

Sure, the West has supplied Ukraine with a considerable amount of weapons 
and imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia. 

Was it enough? Clearly not. 

Is the West doing more, after seeing Bucha? Not really.

The reaction to the photos of hundreds of butchered civilians have so far 
been limited to European countries ousting Russian diplomats and the U.S. 
pushing to have Russia out of the UN Human Rights Council. 

What is the same about these measures? They cost the West nothing, and 
cause it no trouble.

The most cynical is the fact that even as civilians are tortured and 
murdered in Ukraine, European money flows freely and plentifully straight 
into Russia’s pockets as payment for natural gas. 

That money then pays for the tanks that take murderers to their victims. 
That money pays for the propaganda that helps create murderers that then 
redeems them. That money funds Putin’s regime, ensuring that it keeps 
moving and killing. Europe’s gas money is fuel for Putin’s killing machine.

Germany’s Finance Minister Christian Lindner said the EU must “work toward” 
cutting all economic ties with Russia, but nonetheless opposed a 
much-needed embargo on gas imports from Russia to the EU.

Ukraine cannot wait for the EU to develop and fulfill a multi-year plan of 
replacing Russian gas with other sources. There are millions of Ukrainians 
who could face the same fate as the citizens of Bucha in the coming weeks 
and months. They simply cannot wait.

Why should Ukrainians give their lives so that Germans or the French don’t 
lose a shred of their comfort? 

According to the Conseil d’Analyse Économique, the advisory economic 
commission of the French prime minister, a full ban on Russian energy would 
cost Germany’s gross national income between 0.3% and 3%.

That’s the price Germany isn’t willing to pay to prevent more innocent men, 
women and children – potentially, thousands of them – from being raped, 
tortured and executed by Russia.   

*With our outrage fresh and our hearts broken by the images from Bucha, we 
demand that Ukraine receives what it needs to survive, and Russia gets what 
it deserves. *

   - Polish MiGs, S-300 defense systems, artillery ammo, body armor, 
   medical supplies. Every piece of equipment that Ukrainians know how to 
   operate must be transferred to Ukraine immediately. 


   - Ukraine will need supplies. Russia has been destroying every oil 
   refinery and depot in the country. The West must come up with a new 
   Lend-Lease deal for Ukraine, to provide the country with gasoline, 
   equipment, and anything else it will need to fight off Russia. 


   - Russia must lose its revenue streams. This must include a complete ban 
   on Russian energy imports, the closure of all ports for Russian ships, the 
   disconnection of all Russian financial institutions from SWIFT and the 
   seizure of Russian assets abroad.


   - Find a way to kick Russia out of the United Nations Security Council. 
   If that’s not possible, admit that the council is ineffective and dissolve 
   it.

*In short, everything Ukraine has asked for must be provided to it 
immediately. *

*If the West doesn’t do it, there will only be more Buchas. *

*The massacres can be stopped now.*

Ukraine should not have to beg for help. It is fighting for the whole 
democratic world, and paying with the blood of its people. It is in the 
West’s utmost interests that Russia lose this war. Every member of the 
Trans-Atlantic community should be flooding Ukraine with aid and 
ammunition, without Ukraine having to ask. 

We hope that those in the White House, Elysee Palace and Bundestag take a 
good look at the photos from Bucha. At the photos of innocent civilians 
with their hands tied behind their backs, executed simply because they were 
Ukrainian. 

And then they should look at their own hands. When the war is over, will 
there be blood on them?
